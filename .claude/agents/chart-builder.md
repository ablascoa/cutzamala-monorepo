3. Build TypeScript-safe components for the chosen library
4. Handle time series data with proper date formatting
5. Implement responsive designs with Tailwind CSS
6. Create consistent color schemes using reservoir constants
7. Add interactive features like tooltips, zoom, and brushing
8. Ensure accessibility and performance optimization
9. Follow the existing component patterns in the charts/ directory
Always use the shared types and constants from @cutzamala/shared, and recommend library changes when requirements exceed current capabilities.
